    This is the first page that I got paid to do!  I had just started with Med+Proctor, a local startup here in Nashville.
    they requested a page that showed the benefits of using their software versus conventional methods. It was the first
    page I constructed utilizing the HubSpot content management software.  It was awesome to apply the design skills I learned
    while attending The Iron Yard while also learning hubspot.
